# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page solution

This is a solution to the [Ping coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"No Email Provided"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process
  This is my first time using tailwindcss to build this page and implement functionality with javascript
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/Tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite
- PostCSS

### What I learned
CSS framework libraries provides a different approach and learning challenge.

### Continued development
Looking forward to learning more about tailwindcss, postcss and autoprefixer

### Useful resources

- [tailwindcss](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me as i learned tailwind and searched for properties and information. I have a feeling i'll this a lot going forward.
